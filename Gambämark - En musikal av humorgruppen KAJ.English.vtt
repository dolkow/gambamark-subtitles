<i>In Ostrobothnia, a village has built a border wall</i>
<i>and declared independence from the rest of Finland.</i>

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:24.389
<i>The conservative enclave has united</i>
<i>under the slogan "like it used to be"-</i>

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:28.558
<i>-and claim that they will now</i>
<i>create the perfect society.</i>

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:34.594
<i>Russia, North Korea, and Maxmo neighborhood association</i>
<i>have recognized their sovereignty.</i>

<i>Our reporter was there today</i>
<i>when the gates were closed.</i>

00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:48.494
<i>I walk through the Ostrobothnian wasteland</i>
<i>covered by shadows of uncertainty.</i>

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:55.022
<i>On the ground, burnt phones and computers,</i>
<i>charred remains of our digital era.</i>

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:59.926
<i>The wall stretches to the sky,</i>
<i>a homemade monument.</i>

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:04.670
<i>Behind the wall lies the world's newest state.</i>

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.126
<i>The border is closed,</i>
<i>and no one gets in our out.</i>

00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:14.870
<i>Questions abound.</i>
<i>Will human rights be respected?</i>

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:20.582
<i>What laws will apply?</i>
<i>Will they manage to be self-sufficient?</i>

00:01:21.317 --> 00:01:25.272
<i>As long as the refuse to communicate</i>
<i>with the world, we can only speculate-</i>

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:29.832
<i>-what the humanitarian situation is like.</i>

Talko, talko,
there's a talko in Gambämark

00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:25.681
We're all happy here, working together,
we plow, sow, and harrow

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.779
Life is easy here, everything is smooth,
and we shot and killed all shags

00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:33.372
Yes, yes, one more time!

00:02:33.492 --> 00:02:35.192

Hitton litton, satisfied?

Hitton litton, want a little coffee
Hitton litton, and dessert

Meat and potatoes, that's like our drugs
Meat and potatoes, all we eat in Gambämark

00:03:04.187 --> 00:03:08.235
Well well, that hit the spot
We're very full my friend

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.571
We don't have a lot,
so for breakfast

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.670
it'll be meat and potatoes again

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:17.598
Yes! My favorite!
With lingonberries!

Gambämark,
we're around a hundred people

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:59.065
Gambämark,
with no wolves or Finns

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.431
It was better before,
so we closed our door-

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.471
-with a friendly little kick

00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:07.735
So now we live in utopia
here in Gambämark

00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:11.559
So new we live in utopia!

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.967

Who's ready for the daily report?
Maybe... Klas and Kenneth? Go ahead.

00:05:55.284 --> 00:05:58.157
Everything was normal
when we were on patrol

00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:01.333
-I checked the wall
-And I stumbled and fell

00:06:01.516 --> 00:06:07.201
-Not a single scratch on our beautiful wall
-I found chanterelles, what luck

00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:13.689
-The moose population is just right
-Our cow Gunilla was at Rööladon today

00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:19.281
-We checked the saltstone for quality
-I wouldn't say that's my favorite

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:22.857
Thank you very much
A job well done

00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:26.393
It's because of you
that everything works

00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.473
When you patrol
and guard our forests

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:32.153
for Gambämark.

00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:33.441
Thank you, boys.

00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:38.654
What about the sewing circle and Berit?
Did you stitch or cook something?

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:41.878
I made meat and potatoes,
and hope everyone is full-

00:06:42.022 --> 00:06:45.070
knitted 80 gloves,
and a very dapper coat

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.086
seminated the cows,
but there was a thunderstorm

00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:51.038
so now we'll have kalvdans until easter

00:06:51.214 --> 00:06:54.342

just wait until you see

weave, and make quark

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:35.069
As for me, I added to our regulations
because there have been some incidents

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:41.157
Berry-picking rakes are now banned

Josua, are you looking forward
to spending all day with your dad?

00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:41.376
Yes.

00:08:41.528 --> 00:08:46.187
Look, it's full of berries.
But we won't eat them yet.

00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:49.595
Two weeks.
Then it's picking day.

00:08:49.713 --> 00:08:51.097
So what do I write?

00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:55.849
Write that by Slompkärr,
it's approximately...

00:08:57.785 --> 00:09:00.787
...50 buckets of blueberries, and...

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:08.107
...70 buckets of lingonberries.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.922
-You could tell by the smell?
-Yes, my son.

00:09:12.138 --> 00:09:19.010
I've been the leader for 15 years.
You learn a thing or two in that time.

00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:24.210
One day, you will take over,
leading the village in rain and shine-

00:09:24.266 --> 00:09:26.658
-in talko and in topping out celebrations.

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:30.562
Then you'll be the one
standing here sniffing the berries.

00:09:31.218 --> 00:09:33.042
Wow.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.690
Come see!

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:42.050
You can tell,
they picked with berry rakes last year.

00:09:42.322 --> 00:09:45.842
Clawing and pulling
and ruining everything!

00:09:46.442 --> 00:09:50.882
I did the right thing,
banning those berry rakes.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:56.426
As elected official, you have to be ready
to make tough decisions.

00:09:56.746 --> 00:10:01.146
And it is worth it.
We have a fantastic berry year coming.

00:10:01.306 --> 00:10:04.082
We may be able to raise
the allowance by a cup or two.

00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:08.697
-I'll note it down.
-No -- can't promise yet.

00:10:10.258 --> 00:10:13.585
I might as well
walk you through it one more time.

00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:16.745
Once a year,
we have "picking day"-

00:10:16.936 --> 00:10:20.096
-where the whole village picks together.

00:10:20.248 --> 00:10:22.921
And then we collect everything in..?

00:10:23.096 --> 00:10:27.328
-The main freezer box!
-The main freezer box.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:36.072
And then it's my job to calculate
and ponder how much everyone should get.

00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:41.808
-And then what do we do?
-Distribute to those who helped at talko.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:45.864
-Yes, but not as salary..?
-But because it's so tasty.

00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:47.889
Ten points.

00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:50.923
Yummy, yummy.

00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:57.795
-Butterscotch?
-Thanks.

00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:05.567
But why do we do this?

00:11:05.927 --> 00:11:10.949
Couldn't everyone just
pick what they need?

00:11:12.245 --> 00:11:17.225
That would be something!
Like on the outside -- complete chaos!

00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:21.481
You can't imagine
how horrible it was.

00:11:21.665 --> 00:11:28.409
Full of skinny pants, wifi,
and municipality mergers.

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:34.257
No, we're better off here,
because here it is like it used to be.

00:11:34.937 --> 00:11:42.073
When we say it was better in the past,
which past do we mean?

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:50.059
Sooner or later, this will be the past,
so which past are we saying was so good?

00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:56.601
Don't get hung up on details.
It's more of a feeling.

00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:03.965
The important thing is that
everything is kept like it always has been.

00:12:04.373 --> 00:12:11.861
-But then nothing will ever change.
-Exactly. I'm very proud that you get it.

00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:18.478
Well! Take a lap around the woods.
Repeat what I said, try sniffing a bit-

00:12:18.686 --> 00:12:21.817
-and I'll see you at home.
And I'd better take that, or you'll be sick.

00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:26.369
Alright!
Goodbye.

00:12:45.259 --> 00:12:54.754
[piano]

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:59.955
Gray barns, yellow fields

00:13:00.386 --> 00:13:05.450
are the only things I've ever known

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.482
Red farms with white corners

00:13:10.938 --> 00:13:15.426
are the only things I've ever seen

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.325
And I know
it doesn't sound so terrible

00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:26.917
And I know
that I have everything I need

00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:31.709
But even though
I know all that

00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:36.629
I don't have anything
to compare

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:42.037
This is my home
This is my village

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:47.277
I wouldn't trade it for another

00:13:47.485 --> 00:13:50.253
I know all the barns

00:13:50.357 --> 00:13:59.317
and behind a hill
there's nothing but shrubbery

00:14:00.909 --> 00:14:06.012
I have dreamt
about a place

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:10.156
where you can be yourself
and don't have to wear flannel

00:14:10.293 --> 00:14:15.052
A paradise
where you can choose

00:14:15.204 --> 00:14:20.116
between more than knitting socks
or cut up a moose

00:14:20.244 --> 00:14:29.356
Yes, inside me
a hope has been awoken

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:38.852
of a life with more
than just potatoes and stew

00:14:39.172 --> 00:14:43.540
This is my home
This is my village

00:14:43.956 --> 00:14:48.668
If we were to trade it for another

00:14:48.828 --> 00:14:51.196
I would be free of the barns

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:58.236
and behind a hill
I would see a new view

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.844
with open landscapes
and infinite oceans

00:15:04.116 --> 00:15:08.388
without talko
and without demands

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.156
where everything is not about blueberries

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:18.412
a place where I'd fit in

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:25.491
Josua! Everything the light touches
is our municipal kingdom-

00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:28.719
-and one day, it will all be yours.

00:15:28.775 --> 00:15:32.992
-But what about the other side of the wall?
-You must never go there!

00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:37.231
It's a pretentious place
full of pretentious people.

00:15:37.423 --> 00:15:42.183
I don't know what I want
What should I do?

00:15:42.303 --> 00:15:47.007
There's no easy answer here

00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:51.767
I try to do things right
but it goes wrong anyway

00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:55.839
Oh, what am I to do?

00:15:55.967 --> 00:16:00.687
This is my home
This is my village

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:05.287
I wouldn't trade it for another

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:08.071
but I've seen all the barns

00:16:08.143 --> 00:16:18.823
and behind a hill
there's more than just shrubbery

00:16:20.842 --> 00:16:24.706
Something pulls me away
and something wants me to stay

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:31.226
I could run away

00:16:31.922 --> 00:16:37.386
Dad would have to pick his own berries

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:44.474
[applause]

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:48.723
I tell you,
that's something for the top 40!

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:54.891
-Are you talking to me?
-Yes, who else?

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:57.908
I'm not one of those weirdos
who talk to themselves.

00:16:58.036 --> 00:17:03.608
Right, Rafael?
<i>-No, ??? ???</i>

00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:06.966
Hey boy,
would you like a cookie?

00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:09.339
No thank you, I'm good.

00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:12.782
It's from the <i>outside</i>.

00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:19.020
-Where did you get it?
-It was a gift. From god!

00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:22.659
No, I'm just kidding.
I won it in a lottery.

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:27.427
-What lottery?
-The lottery of <i>life</i>.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:32.934
This is a snack cookie
from Elovena with raisin flavor.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:38.726
I once bought a packet,
and when I opened it, a dead mouse!

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.515
So I took the mouse
and put it in a complaint letter-

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:45.475
-and got a reply the next week.

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:49.247
"??? here's your cookie!"

00:17:51.647 --> 00:17:54.738
I got 150 pounds of dry snacks.

00:17:55.498 --> 00:17:58.034
Would you like one?

00:17:58.138 --> 00:18:02.889
-Thank you.
-Well, well. Prrrrr!

00:18:03.452 --> 00:18:05.508
But you won't tell anyone?

00:18:05.592 --> 00:18:09.249
No way, I'm no rat.

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:14.471
-What?
-<i>Snitches get stitches, eh!</i>

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:20.231
-You see Rafael, he's been reading Easy Cash.
-Easy what?

00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:25.131
Cash.
A thing on the outside, instead of blueberries.

00:18:29.949 --> 00:18:33.245
-Have you been on the outside?
-Oh yes.

00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:39.597
Before they put this rotten wall up,
there wasn't any inside or outside.

00:18:39.697 --> 00:18:42.393
I've lived here since I was born.

00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:45.751
Suddenly, these morons come
and put up the wall around me.

00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:51.135
I didn't notice it until the next year
when I was going to put on summer tires.

00:18:53.623 --> 00:18:57.247
-How's it taste?
-Very good.

00:18:57.383 --> 00:19:02.262
It's amazing how they've kept,
despite expiring 15 years ago.

00:19:04.658 --> 00:19:11.293
Can't handle it?
<i>He's a bit of a weakling.</i>

00:19:15.118 --> 00:19:21.106
-Is that a two-stroke?
-Indeed. 50 cc, three gears, and with a...

00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:24.345
-Dellorto carburetor.
...Dellort carburetor.

00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:30.354
There you go!
You're not as dumb as you look.

00:19:30.777 --> 00:19:34.775
It's leaking oil,
so we need to go home change the gaskets.

00:19:34.847 --> 00:19:37.607
-Would you like to come?
-Can I?

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:39.434
Of course.

00:19:39.538 --> 00:19:43.938
-Josua, Kurt's boy.
-Mäskis-Gunnar, village eccentric.

00:19:44.068 --> 00:19:48.623
Hop on.
This reminds me of when I met Rafael.

00:19:48.695 --> 00:19:52.325
It was a stormy autumn night.
He had no pine cones while my pocket was full-

00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:55.053
-so we hit it right off.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.122
[mild rock music]

00:19:58.674 --> 00:20:03.913
Fifteen years in paradise
with moose season all year round

00:20:04.025 --> 00:20:09.025
leaves people happy and full
but the moose population thin

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:13.906
It's a lot of work
to keep them healthy and strong

00:20:14.018 --> 00:20:19.120
'cause we shoot so insistently
and won't let new ones in

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.928
Last year we got trigger happy
and as a result

00:20:25.113 --> 00:20:30.223
we have a couple of moose bulls
and only one cow left

00:20:30.699 --> 00:20:35.506
But she is a star
in the moose sky up above

00:20:35.586 --> 00:20:40.402
who in the last 15 years
always gave us double calves

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:46.170
Gunilla, Gunilla
We sing your holy name

00:20:46.338 --> 00:20:51.482
Gunilla, Gunilla
Mother of all moose

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.954
You're so much more than a moose cow
Without you we'd all perish

00:20:57.274 --> 00:21:03.546
and be forced to eat potatoes
without our minced meat sauce

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.752
Yes, Kenneth!

00:21:08.064 --> 00:21:12.904
We have the honor
of taking care of you

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:18.304
We fill your feeding trough
because you eat so much

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:23.359
The salt lick needs changing
because you are so greedy

00:21:23.863 --> 00:21:29.078
But don't lick it too much
mind your cow-lesterol

00:21:29.262 --> 00:21:34.086
On Monday, you will be brushed
and get a new haircut

00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:39.630
On Tuesday, brisket massage
and front hoof pedicure

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.894
You really deserve it
after what happened last year

00:21:45.358 --> 00:21:50.014
when we shot your calves,
ate your sister, skinned your brother

00:21:50.318 --> 00:21:55.630
Gunilla, Gunilla
We sing your holy name

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.667
Gunilla, Gunilla
Mother of all moose

00:22:00.796 --> 00:22:06.283
You're so much more than a moose cow
Without you we'd all perish

00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:13.115
and be forced to eat potatoes
without our minced meat sauce

00:22:13.556 --> 00:22:18.536
-Well Gunilla, time for today's treatment?
-You've been waiting, yes.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.179
-Leg up, that's good.
-Say aaah.

00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:29.097
-Let's brush all the little teeth.
-Spick and span, only the best.

00:22:29.257 --> 00:22:34.673
-Oh, right in the neck! Hah!
-You rascal you!

00:22:35.609 --> 00:22:40.817
You are our holy moose cow
and you can sleep well this fall

00:22:41.297 --> 00:22:45.761
'cause if anyone tries to shoot you
then we will shoot them first

00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:51.626
Gunilla, Gunilla
We sing your holy name

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:56.730
Gunilla, Gunilla
Mother of all moose

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:01.906
You're so much more than a moose cow
Without you we'd all perish

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:08.586
and be forced to eat potatoes
without-

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:14.034
-minced meat sauce
-Minced meat sauce

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:20.408
[applause]

00:23:37.224 --> 00:23:39.184
Drop that!

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:43.392
No, that! It's from the outside.

00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:46.400
Kenneth to Kurt, over.

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:49.450
Kenneth to Kurt, it's a code red.

00:23:49.498 --> 00:23:54.354
Come one, Kenneth to Kurt, over!
He's not responding!

00:23:54.938 --> 00:23:58.732
This is what we'll do.
You go tell Kurt-

00:23:58.828 --> 00:24:01.162
-and I'll get Gunilla to safety.

00:24:01.274 --> 00:24:05.468
Take care, Klas,
and don't touch that.

00:24:06.221 --> 00:24:08.429
Gunilla!

00:24:15.733 --> 00:24:17.098
Knock, knock!

00:24:17.803 --> 00:24:19.037
Who's there?

00:24:19.243 --> 00:24:20.696
It's Berit.

00:24:20.714 --> 00:24:22.742
Berit who?

00:24:22.886 --> 00:24:24.843
Bare it without asking!

00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:35.477
-Well well, you nailed it!
-That's what she said!

00:24:39.926 --> 00:24:47.285
Are you here for the circle,
or did you just miss me?

00:24:48.033 --> 00:24:55.345
Well, you're so busy
with all the ruling and deciding.

00:24:57.337 --> 00:24:59.441
But here you go.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:09.112
-A jelly pastry! Fresh?
-Just cool enough that you won't get burned.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.904
We sew and embroider
and bake a lot in the circle-

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.696
-and we've done that happily
the latest fifteen years-

00:25:20.792 --> 00:25:28.280
-and we've mostly been using recipes and patterns
from three homemaker magazines from the 50's-

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.096
-that we didn't burn
on the easter fire 2022.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.704
And of course we are very grateful
that we got to keep them, Kurt.

00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:39.641
But it would be nice with something new!

00:25:39.928 --> 00:25:48.008
That is, another embroidery pattern
or maybe try some new recipes?

00:25:48.264 --> 00:25:51.888
Oh, Berit, Berit, my dear.

00:25:52.328 --> 00:25:55.772
I know it may be
hard for you to understand-

00:25:55.868 --> 00:25:58.457
-but that is out of the question.

00:25:58.753 --> 00:26:01.826
But we could rip out any inappropriate pages.

00:26:01.929 --> 00:26:08.708
And then there are the jokes on the back,
that you could read in the village meetings.

00:26:08.828 --> 00:26:11.404
You're so good at telling jokes.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:20.949
[exaggerated laugh]

00:26:21.125 --> 00:26:22.792
No!

00:26:23.464 --> 00:26:26.841
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.

00:26:26.904 --> 00:26:29.915
We don't need any help from outside.

00:26:30.043 --> 00:26:33.613
I already know all the jokes I need.
They just come to me.

00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:35.149
-But couldn't we...
-No!

00:26:35.229 --> 00:26:40.590
Thou shalt not covet
your neighbor's magazine.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.766
Book of the Homestead 7:14.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.018
If you say so,
then that's how it is.

00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:54.816
But couldn't we just bring in one?
I mean, it's me.

00:26:54.872 --> 00:26:58.096
I was here when we started Gambämark.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.448
Without you and I,
we wouldn't be sitting here today.

00:27:02.816 --> 00:27:07.559
Remember when we recruited people
in town squares around Ostrobothnia?

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.790
Those were the days.

00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:14.030
You made the speeches,
and I made the coffee.

00:27:14.438 --> 00:27:20.685
Sometimes, there were more people
in the coffee line than by the speech.

00:27:20.837 --> 00:27:23.244
That doesn't ring  a bell.

00:27:23.468 --> 00:27:28.596
Couldn't you make an exception
for a tiny tiny little magazine?

00:27:28.668 --> 00:27:31.082
Maybe we could
come to some kind of...

00:27:36.762 --> 00:27:38.318
-Code red!
-What?

00:27:38.374 --> 00:27:41.622
-Code red, the owl crowed!
-Huh?

00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:44.758
Code red, the owl cried!

00:27:45.358 --> 00:27:51.598
Klas, show the way.
Berit, we'll have to pick this up later.

00:27:52.414 --> 00:27:58.033
Aren't you bringing this?
Hey, wait!

00:28:27.675 --> 00:28:29.778
Well, this is me!

00:28:30.594 --> 00:28:35.298
Wow, what a cool juicer.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:42.282
This is only for emergencies
and birthdays.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.353
Is today your birthday?

00:28:44.385 --> 00:28:47.785
Nope, but it's surely someone's!

00:28:49.837 --> 00:28:55.196
What a gold mine!

00:28:55.368 --> 00:29:01.456
Say hi to my friends:
Jörgen, Ruben, Gunda, and Hulda.

00:29:02.025 --> 00:29:07.824
-Hello.
-And here, you see Holy Birgitta.

00:29:08.577 --> 00:29:12.721
Gunnar, you're not at all what I expected.

00:29:12.929 --> 00:29:17.227
It's like I always say, boy:
don't judge the book by the cover-

00:29:17.275 --> 00:29:21.315
-because even a slow hare
changes its coat by winter.

00:29:21.643 --> 00:29:22.830
Okay.

00:29:22.878 --> 00:29:25.406
Want to see what I found today?

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:30.230
Mint pre-owned,
found 60 of them on Kaatopaikk.

00:29:30.294 --> 00:29:33.261
-It was banned today, so we can't...
-Yes, calm down.

00:29:33.325 --> 00:29:36.230
-If he sees us with that, we're..!
-Yes yes, calm down man!

00:29:36.806 --> 00:29:43.422
Thou shalt pick the holy berries in the
old way, by hand. Book of the Homestead 13:3.

00:29:46.021 --> 00:29:47.462
Listen, boy.

00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:52.605
What they don't know won't hurt them.
Book of Gunnar 1:1.

00:29:55.445 --> 00:30:00.108
And I can't let this go to waste
just because Kurt freaked out again.

00:30:00.204 --> 00:30:04.230
You shouldn't care so much
what other people say, boy.

00:30:04.835 --> 00:30:10.065
But hey, I have a important question.
Do you like boogie woogie?

00:30:10.165 --> 00:30:11.789
[boogie woogie]

00:30:12.563 --> 00:30:17.851
See Josua,
I think we may be more alike than you think.

00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:22.613
Woo!

00:30:28.913 --> 00:30:30.809
So listen up...

00:30:32.912 --> 00:30:34.191
...boy!

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:41.531
When I was young, everyone said
"Gunnar is a strange one"

00:30:42.603 --> 00:30:49.267
But years passed, and I grew up
and I'm still strange

00:30:50.267 --> 00:30:56.730
They said I would get a girl and kids
walk around in fancy clothes

00:30:57.931 --> 00:31:04.346
but I traded a luxurious life
for an ugly hat and moped

00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:13.090
The life I live is mine alone
<i>To each their own</i>

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:20.234
I don't know no one, but everyone knows me
You know who I am!

00:31:20.562 --> 00:31:28.098
I am Mäskis-Gunnar
I am Mäskis-Gunnar

00:31:28.324 --> 00:31:35.802
??? with ??? ???
Completely unshowered, smell funky

00:31:36.018 --> 00:31:40.722
I live my life
and I've never ever regretted that choice

00:31:40.842 --> 00:31:43.390
<i>He's a village eccentric</i>

00:31:43.558 --> 00:31:48.414
Been called a lot
but never been called normal

00:31:48.534 --> 00:31:51.030
<i>He's a village eccentric</i>

00:31:51.174 --> 00:31:56.222
Crafted my hat
from a dead raccoon

00:31:56.359 --> 00:31:58.702
<i>He is a odd old man</i>

00:31:58.806 --> 00:32:03.638
and these pants
are the only pair I have

00:32:03.774 --> 00:32:05.990
<i>What a man!</i>

00:32:06.422 --> 00:32:13.870
I am Mäskis-Gunnar
I am Mäskis-Gunnar

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:21.694
Taxidermies every roadkill
Is a bit confused and smells bad

00:32:27.833 --> 00:32:29.163
Gunnar!

00:32:29.715 --> 00:32:33.832
I think I understand what you're saying!
You should just be yourself.

00:32:33.888 --> 00:32:37.320
-Shut up, let's dance!

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.710
Woo!

00:32:44.141 --> 00:32:45.362
Yeah!

00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:51.355
Boogie woogie, yeah!

00:32:52.162 --> 00:32:55.946
<i>Mäskis-Gunnar</i>
Dances on the table

00:32:56.042 --> 00:32:59.998
<i>Mäskis-Gunnar</i>
Boogie woogie in my blood

00:33:00.238 --> 00:33:03.770
<i>Mäskis-Gunnar</i>
A little like Buddha

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:08.906
<i>Mäskis-Gunnar</i>
for everyone different

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:16.650
I am Mäskis-Gunnar
I am Mäskis-Gunnar

00:33:16.898 --> 00:33:19.914
Happiness is total

00:33:20.034 --> 00:33:27.784
so won't you be a village eccentric
<i>Han är Mäskis-Gunnar</i>

00:33:28.271 --> 00:33:32.444
<i>Han är Mäskis-Gunnar</i>
And I declare

00:33:34.532 --> 00:33:39.707
Boogie woogie, yeah!

00:33:42.179 --> 00:33:44.685
[applause]

00:33:44.829 --> 00:34:01.652
[music continues]

00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:12.211
[light rain and bird sounds]

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.616
What we know so far
is that we've found contraband in the woods.

00:35:12.729 --> 00:35:16.718
We suspect it's a cookie.
A <i>factory</i> cookie.

00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:21.725
How is this possible?
I have banned factory cookies from outside.

00:35:21.805 --> 00:35:27.092
If Berit's oatmeal cookies aren't enough,
then you must be an infidel.

00:35:27.865 --> 00:35:32.361
On top of the smuggling
and illegal possession of snacks- 

00:35:32.433 --> 00:35:40.105
-we also have to consider that Gunilla,
our holy moose cow, could have choked.

00:35:40.625 --> 00:35:45.769
Then we wouldn't have any moose cow left,
and the moose population would die out.

00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:51.548
We can't risk anything happening to Gunilla.
Not a single hair will fall from her head.

00:35:51.652 --> 00:35:56.605
People must have their meat and potatoes.
Book of the Homestead 3:3.

00:35:59.037 --> 00:36:06.301
What will the punishment be?
Cleaning 500 litres of lingonberries?

00:36:06.453 --> 00:36:12.032
No, a few barrels of berries and pine needles
would be far from enough.

00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:15.232
It will be excommunication.

00:36:17.771 --> 00:36:25.979
Klas. How goes the crime scene investigation?
Any leads on the cookie chewer?

00:36:28.531 --> 00:36:32.571
-Well, I accidentally ate it.
-You're too much, spit it...

00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:35.507
-Oil!
-I was just thinking that.

00:36:35.587 --> 00:36:40.605
-No, it's made with butter...
-Shush! Throw it away.

00:36:40.749 --> 00:36:46.142
There's been a two-stroke here,
leaking like a sieve.

00:36:48.574 --> 00:36:53.837
Who do we know
that drives a two-stroke?

00:36:57.214 --> 00:37:01.630
Long beard.
Smells bad.

00:37:01.751 --> 00:37:04.687
Well, I have no idea.

00:37:04.911 --> 00:37:06.695
Come on.

00:37:10.383 --> 00:37:12.007
Dear diary.

00:37:15.465 --> 00:37:19.442
Today's the first day of my new life

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:23.353
Something big happened today

00:37:24.689 --> 00:37:28.929
I was not sure at first, but I went

00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:32.969
Now I'd never have it undone

00:37:33.393 --> 00:37:36.809
I met a man who showed me the way

00:37:36.977 --> 00:37:41.801
No, not like that!
It was a squirrel.

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:46.249
I found a puzzle piece that filled a hole

00:37:46.793 --> 00:37:50.020
next to a taxidermied vole

00:37:50.275 --> 00:37:58.763
Yes, finally
I found a person who understands

00:37:58.955 --> 00:38:03.780
He's a little special
but he's kind

00:38:04.196 --> 00:38:07.931
I have something I didn't have yesterday

00:38:08.075 --> 00:38:12.499
I have a friend
I have a friend

00:38:12.555 --> 00:38:16.835
One who's never going to leave me
I can say it once again

00:38:16.955 --> 00:38:21.355
I have a friend
I have a friend

00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:26.275
I will never be alone again

00:38:26.827 --> 00:38:30.787
Next Monday, we're cooking together

00:38:31.243 --> 00:38:34.867
He told me to bring the yeast

00:38:35.715 --> 00:38:39.163
15 pounds does sound like a lot

00:38:40.155 --> 00:38:43.571
I wonder what kind of pastry it'll be

00:38:44.891 --> 00:38:48.319
And he's going to teach me MIG welding

00:38:48.383 --> 00:38:52.295
Wow - we'll see how it goes

00:38:53.687 --> 00:38:57.926
We're going to build a berry picking machine

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:01.638
I have the blueprints ready

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:09.950
And it feels so good to be
with someone just like me

00:39:10.494 --> 00:39:15.110
A little special
but still kind

00:39:15.366 --> 00:39:19.069
I wish it was Monday today

00:39:19.165 --> 00:39:23.565
I have a friend
I have a friend

00:39:23.693 --> 00:39:27.933
One who's never going to leave me
I can say it once again

00:39:28.077 --> 00:39:32.325
I have a friend
I have a friend

00:39:32.397 --> 00:39:36.861
I will never be alone again

00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:41.925
And I can hear him call my name
<i>Josua!</i>

00:39:42.053 --> 00:39:46.429
with his arms stretched out
<i>Aaaaah!</i>

00:39:46.533 --> 00:39:51.029
and he would never hold back
<i>Come here!</i>

00:39:51.141 --> 00:39:54.733
if I needed help
<i>Help!</i>

00:39:54.853 --> 00:39:59.290
I have a friend
I have a friend

00:39:59.402 --> 00:40:03.498
One who's never going to leave me
I can say it once again

00:40:03.618 --> 00:40:10.138
I have a friend
I have a friend

00:40:10.242 --> 00:40:15.186
I will never be alone again!

00:40:16.158 --> 00:40:19.774
[applause]

00:40:21.238 --> 00:40:26.565
[march with organ and bells]

00:40:28.497 --> 00:40:31.745
Umph! Weak throw!

00:40:50.649 --> 00:40:55.599
By the power vested in me as elected official
I sentence you to excommunication.

00:40:55.903 --> 00:41:01.010
???

00:41:01.866 --> 00:41:03.618
Gunnar Mäsk!

00:41:03.723 --> 00:41:08.699
You are sentenced for countless sins
and dirty deeds of your own will-

00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:12.229
-rejecting our holy Book of the Homestead.

00:41:12.381 --> 00:41:15.933
By smuggling illegal goods
from the cursed outside-

00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:21.900
-you have risked the village's prosperity
and the holy moose cow Gunilla's life.

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:26.389
Also, you're pretentious
and smell bad.

00:41:26.493 --> 00:41:31.949
Yes, begone ???

00:41:33.629 --> 00:41:39.500
Well? Any last words, Mäskis-Gunnar?

00:41:40.324 --> 00:41:46.972
Yes. Nice wig!
Or maybe I should say-

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.260
Baaa!

00:41:49.347 --> 00:41:51.467
Get him out!

00:41:55.405 --> 00:42:00.710
Out of the village you are thrown

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:06.070
Those who neglect the Book
are erased

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:11.942
Our village says shame,
you are thrown out, that's it.

00:42:12.158 --> 00:42:16.313
Can't you take a joke, Kurt?

00:42:16.377 --> 00:42:21.824
-No, give me Rafael!
-You are rejected from here for all time

00:42:22.048 --> 00:42:27.281
-Rafael!
-Suffering will be the penalty for your sins

00:42:27.393 --> 00:42:33.175
-No, Rafael!
-Bless Kurt, we don't want outsiders here

00:42:33.447 --> 00:42:37.636
You're not the least bit kind!

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.147
[bird song]

00:42:42.253 --> 00:42:46.146
Finally one can breathe again.

00:43:02.262 --> 00:43:05.039
-Hi dad! A question.
-Yes?

00:43:05.127 --> 00:43:07.353
Do we have any yeast?

00:43:08.107 --> 00:43:10.306
No, I think we're out.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:15.467
Have you seen my radio phone?
I've told you it's not a toy.

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:18.411
No, I haven't seen it.

00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:22.003
I'll have to take the spare for now.

00:43:22.307 --> 00:43:28.806
You should have been at the excommunication,
so you learn how it's done.

00:43:28.901 --> 00:43:33.436
It was like "out of the village, bless Kurt!"

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:39.708
-Who was it this time?
-The weirdo who lived up at Kaatopaikk.

00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:42.247
Mäskis-Gunnar.

00:43:43.822 --> 00:43:47.343
-What did you say?
-Mäskis-Gunnar.

00:43:47.711 --> 00:43:51.437
He had smuggled cookies. <i>Factory</i> cookies!

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:57.659
Threw it in the forest, plastic and all.
Who knows what he would've brought in next?

00:43:57.812 --> 00:44:04.012
It's like I always say:
it starts with Elovena, but ends with ecstacy.

00:44:07.013 --> 00:44:09.717
But he was my friend!

00:44:11.013 --> 00:44:14.997
What? You knew that kook?

00:44:15.325 --> 00:44:19.029
Good thing he was thrown out, then.

00:44:19.269 --> 00:44:24.573
You can't associate
with such wandering wastebins!

00:44:26.245 --> 00:44:30.501
This fall,
you're joining the moose hunt-

00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:32.531
-so you'll learn to be a man.

00:44:32.565 --> 00:44:36.709
People like Mäskis-Gunnar make you weak, Josua.

00:44:36.885 --> 00:44:41.300
Weak-Josua, that's what they'll call you here.
Is that what you want?

00:44:41.307 --> 00:44:45.823
-No, I don't, but I don't think...
-Weak-Josua!

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.581
You don't think?
Stop crying, then.

00:44:50.067 --> 00:44:53.825
Shape up, crybaby.

00:44:57.395 --> 00:45:00.315
Oh my god, what have I done?

00:45:02.571 --> 00:45:06.531
Gunnar was nothing but kind

00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:10.220
Sure, he did some things

00:45:10.315 --> 00:45:13.891
but how could that be so wrong?

00:45:14.443 --> 00:45:19.691
The old man took a blow for me

00:45:21.043 --> 00:45:26.571
What have I done to deserve this?

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:32.437
Why should a boy feel this bad?

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:38.356
Here I am in need,
No support, too much ???

00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:43.598
There must be others who feel the same way

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:51.606
Help me!

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.830
I can help you, Josua.

00:45:56.857 --> 00:45:58.993
You see, life isn't always easy.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:03.474
We all go through tough times,
but we just have to manage.

00:46:03.554 --> 00:46:05.512
And there is a trick or two.

00:46:05.584 --> 00:46:10.535
Now listen real close,
and I'll tell you how it was for me.

00:46:10.676 --> 00:46:12.870
Here it is.

00:46:12.972 --> 00:46:17.524
I lived home with my mom
and went out for a date

00:46:17.588 --> 00:46:22.581
It was a musical
and I was young and he was hot

00:46:22.828 --> 00:46:27.117
He had asked me out
I thought he was so nice

00:46:27.196 --> 00:46:31.844
A magical summer eve

00:46:32.148 --> 00:46:36.754
We went out to the ocean
and we danced together

00:46:36.858 --> 00:46:41.618
I remember the embers of love

00:46:41.834 --> 00:46:46.466
When I came home late
and went to tell my mom

00:46:46.802 --> 00:46:50.169
the old lady had died!

00:46:50.826 --> 00:46:56.366
When everything is awful
and you can't see the end

00:46:56.422 --> 00:47:00.702
You should just suck it up
and put on a smile

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.528
No, you shouldn't cry
although everything is crap

00:47:05.624 --> 00:47:10.854
Keep it inside and make peace with
that living is just hard

00:47:11.166 --> 00:47:13.591
Thank you very much,
but this isn't at all what I need today...

00:47:13.679 --> 00:47:19.696
Well, Josua.
Life can feel like a long punch in the gut.

00:47:20.327 --> 00:47:25.104
I'd been saving money,
working hard doing piece work

00:47:25.184 --> 00:47:29.496
Grandpa was dying,
he was sick and needed care

00:47:29.944 --> 00:47:34.512
We didn't have any money,
so we were desperate

00:47:34.608 --> 00:47:38.496
A man showed up
who really knew how to talk

00:47:38.664 --> 00:47:43.808
He said <i>hey, invest now</i>
<i>'cause the market is so good</i>

00:47:44.137 --> 00:47:48.648
<i>and it well never fall</i>

00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:53.536
I shouldn't have listened
to what that horsetrader said

00:47:53.672 --> 00:47:57.408
I lost my grandpa in OneCoin

00:47:58.588 --> 00:48:03.100
When everything is awful
and you can't see the end

00:48:03.668 --> 00:48:07.948
You should just suck it up
and put on a smile

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:12.519
No, you shouldn't cry
although everything is crap

00:48:12.749 --> 00:48:17.509
Keep it inside and make peace with
that living is just hard

00:48:17.605 --> 00:48:22.380
I remember february
when I was depressed

00:48:22.448 --> 00:48:27.210
The kids had a stomach bug
and my husband was on leave

00:48:27.289 --> 00:48:32.163
I didn't want to get up
and could barely take a step

00:48:32.282 --> 00:48:39.715
My life was at rock bottom then
but there was a cure

00:48:40.158 --> 00:48:42.952
-Can you guess what, Josua?
-To suck it up and put on a...

00:48:43.024 --> 00:48:47.643
When everything is awful
and you can't see the end

00:48:48.076 --> 00:48:52.452
You should just suck it up
and put on a smile

00:48:52.508 --> 00:48:57.109
No, you shouldn't cry
although everything is crap

00:48:57.244 --> 00:49:01.964
Keep it inside and make peace with
that living is just hard

00:49:02.093 --> 00:49:06.701
So when sorrows beg for attention
don't let them drain your energy

00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:11.700
When your demons wake in the morning
you should drown them in work

00:49:11.796 --> 00:49:16.620
Do something that makes you forget
Chop or bake or weave

00:49:16.884 --> 00:49:20.139
Yes, you just have to make peace with

00:49:20.395 --> 00:49:30.588
Living is just hard

00:49:33.099 --> 00:49:41.003
[applause]

00:50:20.412 --> 00:50:22.102
Are you alive?

00:50:22.174 --> 00:50:23.678
Barely.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.606
Heavens, why are you lying there?

00:50:26.704 --> 00:50:28.512
Because I'm sad.

00:50:28.552 --> 00:50:35.520
Oh, but you can't just lie here.
Come with me to the circle.

00:50:35.576 --> 00:50:40.216
-But...
-But, but - no buts.

00:50:40.313 --> 00:50:45.176
We're weaving
something really nice.

00:50:47.976 --> 00:50:51.232
I think you'd like to see it.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.568
Come with me, Josua.

00:50:58.602 --> 00:51:03.442
[rock music with organ]

00:51:29.074 --> 00:51:30.674
Well, here we are!

00:51:30.842 --> 00:51:34.954
[cough, cough]

00:51:35.242 --> 00:51:40.258
Darn it,
how could we burn the buns like that!

00:51:42.712 --> 00:51:45.631
Oh, Berit, you're bringing guests?

00:51:45.703 --> 00:51:52.258
Yes, see who I found!
Come closer to the heater, Josua.

00:51:52.463 --> 00:51:55.655
-Have you met the other sewing ladies?
-No.

00:51:56.849 --> 00:52:03.343
This is Gita,
and this is Margita.

00:52:04.375 --> 00:52:06.815
-Josue is a bit sad.

00:52:06.927 --> 00:52:09.917
-Oh no, what did you say?
-Oh, little buddy!

00:52:09.997 --> 00:52:14.449
-Come here, we'll get you better!
-Come, come, there you go.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:18.322
-You look cold, want some socks?
-No thanks, I'm good.

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:23.704
-I'll put some one, your feed may be cold.
-We'll put on a warm blanket.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:30.236
-The best blanket, have a hot drink.
-Yes, that's fine, thanks.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:35.652
-Now, what's weighing on you, dear?

00:52:37.324 --> 00:52:41.748
-You know how Mäskis-Gunnar was excommunicated?
-Mmm.

00:52:42.237 --> 00:52:45.620
-And it was my fault.
-Oh no.

00:52:45.796 --> 00:52:48.970
-Poor little you, what a thing.
-Oh oh oh, how sad!

00:52:49.009 --> 00:52:51.864
But how could that be your fault?

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:57.346
He gave me a cookie in the forest,
I threw it away and they found it-

00:52:57.402 --> 00:53:01.226
-and blamed him
and now he's on the outside because of me.

00:53:01.483 --> 00:53:07.336
-Oh no, oh no...
-Oh dear, what misfortune.

00:53:07.408 --> 00:53:09.936
But how were you to know
what was going to happen?

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.447
Exactly, people are excommunicated
for anything nowadays.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.899
Yes, that's for sure.
My sister was here on Monday-

00:53:17.971 --> 00:53:22.127
--the one who lived at--
-thimble on the wrong finger-

00:53:22.278 --> 00:53:25.314
--and I said--
-what's the harm-

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:30.150
Here we're forced to work at talko
and to dance folk dance

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:33.542
-and the pants are itching
and I hate it!

00:53:33.774 --> 00:53:35.119
And why is it like that?

00:53:35.199 --> 00:53:37.345
Because dad is an asshole.

00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:40.602
No, I didn't mean that.

00:53:40.746 --> 00:53:44.906
Girls, I think he's ready.

00:53:47.082 --> 00:53:49.218
You're not going to report me, right?

00:53:49.234 --> 00:53:54.138
Josue, you've come to the right place.

00:53:55.099 --> 00:53:57.269
As long as there's no more folk music.

00:53:57.533 --> 00:54:01.573
[folk music]

00:54:04.253 --> 00:54:16.357
They think that we know only seams
without our own wishes or dreams

00:54:16.805 --> 00:54:22.104
they leave us be
with our embroidery

00:54:22.624 --> 00:54:27.848
but soon they all will see

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:38.144
There is a dough that is rising
Without any of them realizing

00:54:38.728 --> 00:54:43.600
Our aprons deflect
anything suspect

00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:49.384
hiding a budding army

00:54:49.584 --> 00:54:57.496
Now we are primed
You came here just in time

00:54:57.872 --> 00:55:00.927
Junta!
The junta is here

00:55:01.295 --> 00:55:04.391
No more knitting needles
now we are a force to fear

00:55:04.655 --> 00:55:07.719
Junta!
We'll make them change the course

00:55:07.873 --> 00:55:10.852
the junta shows its force

00:55:11.452 --> 00:55:17.669
We are here lurking already
with rolling pins at the ready

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.357
They think we're sweet ladies
with coffee and pastries

00:55:21.429 --> 00:55:24.757
but soon their heads will be rolling

00:55:24.893 --> 00:55:31.221
A needle in the right hands
can bring down both villages and countries

00:55:31.414 --> 00:55:34.733
We're tired of empty words
and we won't back down

00:55:34.997 --> 00:55:38.221
In formation, attack!

00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:44.797
We're going to fight
Join us in our struggle

00:55:45.253 --> 00:55:48.221
Junta!
The junta, we shout

00:55:48.653 --> 00:55:51.605
No more knitting, ladies
let's bring the big guns out

00:55:52.013 --> 00:55:55.117
Junta!
We'll make them change the course

00:55:55.293 --> 00:55:58.141
the junta shows its force

00:55:58.749 --> 00:56:05.013
Berit, our Berit
Berit is our general

00:56:05.557 --> 00:56:11.581
Berit, our Berit
Berit, she will bear it all

00:56:11.909 --> 00:56:18.390
Once when I was out for a walk
I saw Berit stand

00:56:18.845 --> 00:56:25.192
choking out full grown moose
with nothing but her hands

00:56:25.821 --> 00:56:31.869
Others chop their firewood
'til they want to die

00:56:32.565 --> 00:56:39.072
Berit just stares at a piece
and it splits all by itself!

00:56:52.781 --> 00:56:56.197
Junta - they we're sweet ladies
Junta - with coffee and pastries

00:56:56.259 --> 00:56:59.323
The junta is over baking and curtsying

00:56:59.555 --> 00:57:02.875
Junta - we're taking over
Junta - taking the power

00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:06.058
We're going to war

00:57:06.354 --> 00:57:09.330
Junta!
Yes, the junta believes

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.762
At the ready,
hope you want revolution

00:57:13.178 --> 00:57:16.114
Junta!
We want you

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.562
If you want to join, then say - okay!

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.858
We're gonna make them see
It's time for mutiny

00:57:23.082 --> 00:57:26.266
Put the pedal to the metal
Here comes our army

00:57:26.706 --> 00:57:29.634
All we want
when we've won

00:57:30.122 --> 00:57:35.130
Kurt. Be. Gone!

00:57:35.209 --> 00:57:36.857
But first, coffee.

00:57:37.435 --> 00:57:43.499
[applause]

00:57:45.144 --> 00:57:47.113
[owls and animals of the night]

00:57:48.209 --> 00:57:53.601
[synth music]

00:58:19.149 --> 00:58:22.406
I have found my calling
The meaning of life

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:26.486
When the berries ripen
I go out into the forest

00:58:26.976 --> 00:58:30.280
Yes yes yes darn it
Then I don my boots

00:58:30.384 --> 00:58:33.992
Working and toiling
to get a couple of litres

00:58:34.128 --> 00:58:37.768
Sure I am ???
snarling and filling the freezer

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.524
with blue berries and lingon

00:58:41.726 --> 00:58:45.414
I think you get the hint
I'm going to fill my bucket

00:58:45.518 --> 00:58:47.798
like a machine with the rakes

00:58:48.974 --> 00:58:50.189
Berry king

00:58:56.844 --> 00:58:58.404
Berry king

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.641
I pick the berries, baby
One, two, three

00:59:09.049 --> 00:59:12.457
Empty the buckets on the kitchen table

00:59:12.574 --> 00:59:15.127
I'm a bad boy
Berry mad boy

00:59:15.508 --> 00:59:19.752
And if it comes to it
I could clean 100 litres in a night

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.639
I put the berries in the tub
I seal the tub with the lid

00:59:23.711 --> 00:59:27.551
and on the lid
I write the year and the kind

00:59:27.615 --> 00:59:31.831
I make both jam and squash
I package and label

00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:34.911
and everything goes in the freezer
Who am I?

00:59:35.583 --> 00:59:37.100
Berry king

00:59:43.319 --> 00:59:45.086
Berry king

00:59:51.103 --> 00:59:52.103
Berry-

00:59:54.022 --> 00:59:56.516
Berit, Berit, Berit

00:59:56.851 --> 00:59:58.066
Woo!

00:59:58.346 --> 00:59:59.780
Tell it like it is

01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:04.076
What what what

01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:10.140
When he's working in the forest
I'm sitting comfortably

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.141
and if he's the berry king
then I'm the berry kingpin

01:00:14.299 --> 01:00:18.171
I've got everybody with me
Heavy chains around my neck

01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:21.875
The boy toils in the forest
Berit doesn't bear a berry.

01:00:21.995 --> 01:00:25.939
Whatever I say goes
and that's all there is to say

01:00:25.995 --> 01:00:29.578
You can join another junta
if you have a problem with that

01:00:29.802 --> 01:00:33.530
The recruit is in the forest
and when the berries ripen

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:38.562
the general shouts "pick"
and leans back on the throne

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:42.905
Berry queen, berry queen, berry queen,
berry queen, berry queen, berry queen

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.351
Pick, pick, pick!

01:00:45.793 --> 01:00:48.624
We're picking the berries
for pleasure and commerce

01:00:49.553 --> 01:00:52.555
Filling up every cup
until the body breaks

01:00:52.731 --> 01:00:56.412
We're picking with rakes
until the rakes clog up

01:00:57.338 --> 01:01:00.230
The juicer is running hard

01:01:00.726 --> 01:01:02.238
Berry king

01:01:02.638 --> 01:01:04.494
Yeah!

01:01:08.422 --> 01:01:09.950
Berry queen

01:01:16.198 --> 01:01:17.742
Berry king

01:01:18.186 --> 01:01:20.350
[applause]

01:01:36.108 --> 01:01:39.956
[Hitton Litton]

01:01:40.451 --> 01:01:44.547
Hitton litton, wanna go to talko
Hitton litton, pick some berries

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:49.403
Hitton litton, wanna go to talko
Why is it that no one's here?

01:01:52.345 --> 01:01:55.116
Hello?
Come out.

01:01:55.619 --> 01:01:59.338
It's ten past talko,
and it's the best day of the year.

01:01:59.426 --> 01:02:01.088
Picking day!

01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:06.417
Hello?

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.058
Where are my berries?

01:02:19.785 --> 01:02:23.790
Not you too,
poor little berry twig.

01:02:25.858 --> 01:02:28.577
Oh my god, what have they done?

01:02:31.703 --> 01:02:35.151
Who has emptied my forest?

01:02:37.071 --> 01:02:41.479
The twig is completely bare,
not even the leaves are there

01:02:42.543 --> 01:02:48.063
Someone has been through here
like a plow

01:02:50.423 --> 01:02:54.936
What have I done
to deserve this?

01:02:56.023 --> 01:03:00.346
Why should an old man feel this bad?

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:06.642
Those who pilfered my berries
will pay for this

01:03:07.882 --> 01:03:14.346
even if its the last thing I do

01:03:15.401 --> 01:03:17.689
They're going to regret this!

01:03:18.904 --> 01:03:24.395
[laughter]

01:03:26.091 --> 01:03:31.458
I've talked to Kurt about getting
some magazines from the outside.

01:03:31.673 --> 01:03:36.638
I have a connection that could
get us weapons for the revolution.

01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:41.694
If you order three magazines,
you get a knife set for free.

01:03:42.969 --> 01:03:46.225
We'll subscribe for a year,
and get a shotgun.

01:03:46.919 --> 01:03:49.954
Woo!
Now the forest is all out of berries!

01:03:50.075 --> 01:03:52.817
Dad is going to be pissed,
this means war!

01:03:53.865 --> 01:03:58.905
-Calm down.
-Ready? Jjjjjunta!

01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:02.913
No more knitting, ladies,
the old man's going bye, hey!

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:12.185
Let's take a deep breath.
Don't run headfirst into the wall.

01:04:12.476 --> 01:04:16.124
But good job on the berries.

01:04:16.469 --> 01:04:22.173
We're starting to have everything we need,
and people are coming over to our side.

01:04:22.631 --> 01:04:26.396
The next step will be
to create disorder in leadership.

01:04:26.783 --> 01:04:30.391
How do we get Kurt, Klas, and Kenneth to fight?

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.205
The main freezer box!
We hit it.

01:04:34.284 --> 01:04:38.043
We empty the berry reserve.
Then he'll be pissed-

01:04:38.076 --> 01:04:41.826
-especially at Klas and Kenneth who...
-Margita, you had an idea?

01:04:42.093 --> 01:04:45.730
-Can't you hear me out...
-No, that's far too dangerous.

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:48.943
We don't want to reveal ourselves yet.
Everything in good time.

01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:53.349
You've just emptied the forest,
we have berries without end.

01:04:59.237 --> 01:05:03.413
Let's write
a note that says-

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.060
"Klas, you're stupid.
Regards, Kenneth"

01:05:08.088 --> 01:05:10.544
And then put that under the door.

01:05:11.527 --> 01:05:16.973
-Oh my god.
-I think you've got something there.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.149
Let's brainstorm some more,
but keep that as a fallback-

01:05:21.329 --> 01:05:23.441
-and we'll see where it goes.

01:05:23.479 --> 01:05:28.963
Seriously?
That's the worst idea I've ever heard.

01:05:28.996 --> 01:05:35.092
Got something better?
There's nothing wrong with Gita's idea.

01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:41.216
-Had it in my back pocket for a while.
-You can put it up your back pocket...

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.584
Junta!

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:48.222
Hey, girls!
They're the target, not us.

01:05:52.174 --> 01:05:53.950
Let's take it from the top.

01:05:56.582 --> 01:06:00.366
First we took the berries
into our custody

01:06:00.782 --> 01:06:04.382
The villagers had their share
and got three buckets each

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:08.502
Now the people is with us
Believe in our cause

01:06:08.685 --> 01:06:12.678
'cause many of them would surely
want to give Kurt a kick

01:06:13.189 --> 01:06:19.933
Soon, we can take him because
people trust their gut

01:06:20.701 --> 01:06:25.117
We'll put a spoke in their wheel
Throw a monkey wrench in

01:06:25.326 --> 01:06:28.814
Sneak lightly on our toes
and keep under the radar

01:06:28.934 --> 01:06:33.434
We'll put a spoke in their wheel
so the other spokes break

01:06:33.794 --> 01:06:37.706
All people need is berries
And there it is

01:06:38.468 --> 01:06:41.250
Weren't we lurking
with rolling pins?

01:06:41.361 --> 01:06:43.897
Shush.
-Margita, how are you doing?

01:06:46.057 --> 01:06:49.897
We have a walkie talkie,
so that we can hear

01:06:50.113 --> 01:06:54.065
what Kurt and Klas and Kenneth's saying
and what they do

01:06:54.233 --> 01:06:58.049
I listened all night long,
tried to stay awake

01:06:58.409 --> 01:07:02.329
despite Kenneth reading stories
at Klas' bedtime

01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:09.521
Oh, aren't they cute
It's like taking candy from a baby

01:07:10.312 --> 01:07:14.783
We'll put a spoke in their wheel
Throw a monkey wrench in

01:07:14.984 --> 01:07:18.464
We have them on the hook,
we have the walkie talkie

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:23.090
We'll put a spoke in their wheel
so the other spokes break

01:07:23.538 --> 01:07:27.634
Whatever they do, we will know
And there it is

01:07:30.952 --> 01:07:35.382
What is this?
I'm out.

01:07:44.892 --> 01:07:47.373
Happy now?
"There it is."

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:50.422
Can't we hit the main freezer now?

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:52.777
Shush!
They're saying something.

01:07:54.494 --> 01:07:58.302
<i>Kenneth, have you seen my left boot?</i>

01:08:00.542 --> 01:08:04.160
<i>Not again.</i>
<i>You've got to use the rubber band.</i>

01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:07.832
<i>-Where are you?</i>
<i>-By Sjiudaladoback.</i>

01:08:10.272 --> 01:08:12.388
-Did you hear?
-He lost his boot.

01:08:12.476 --> 01:08:16.318
No, about Sjuidaladoback.
I think I know what we have to do.

01:08:17.986 --> 01:08:19.983
-We'll move the salt lick
-Why?

01:08:20.175 --> 01:08:22.488
-So we can trip them
-I'm lost

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.990
We'll move it from A to B
and we'll have victory

01:08:26.237 --> 01:08:28.234
-We'll move the salt lick
-Good idea

01:08:28.409 --> 01:08:30.777
-So we can trip them
-I'm with you

01:08:30.969 --> 01:08:34.609
And we know how it will end
because our plan is done

01:08:34.697 --> 01:08:39.019
We'll put a spoke in their wheel
Throw a monkey wrench in

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:42.587
When they are out shooting
we will move the salt lick

01:08:42.803 --> 01:08:47.358
We'll put a spoke in their wheel
so the other spokes break

01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:51.622
-Eventually, they will quiver
-I'm off the wagon

01:08:51.798 --> 01:08:57.710
Eventually, we'll get them
And there it is

01:09:00.159 --> 01:09:03.684
[applause]

01:09:12.076 --> 01:09:15.934
Hello, hello.
As you know, today was picking day-

01:09:16.686 --> 01:09:18.208
-and where were you?

01:09:19.208 --> 01:09:22.736
Oh, a stomach bug.
No, don't come closer!

01:09:23.772 --> 01:09:26.144
Go inside, shut the door,
and keep it shut.

01:09:35.186 --> 01:09:38.506
Hi, hi.
Is your hubby in the forest?

01:09:39.106 --> 01:09:43.660
No, I was just wondering
if Perry is here or can help carry berries.

01:09:46.227 --> 01:09:48.041
Oh, it's nothing to worry about-

01:09:48.111 --> 01:09:54.095
-but for your own sake,
please tell me later where he was.

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:06.751
Hey hey!
Picking day came and went, and-

01:10:07.351 --> 01:10:08.855
You're having pie?

01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:11.982
Where did you get the berries?

01:10:12.691 --> 01:10:16.557
Last year's?
They're long gone, I'll tell you-

01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:21.484
We don't slam doors,
Book of the Homestead 25:8!

01:10:26.098 --> 01:10:27.458
Klas and Kenneth, over.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.953
Klas and Kenneth, over, it's code blue.

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:33.490
The sow is out, I repeat: the sow is out.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:39.236
<i>Klas and Kenneth, over. Hello? Hello?</i>

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:43.319
Turn off that whining.

01:11:02.794 --> 01:11:04.882
[Spanish guitar]

01:11:05.418 --> 01:11:13.851
When we're grilling our wieners
I can't help but think

01:11:15.259 --> 01:11:21.876
about how life would be
if I could join with you

01:11:22.339 --> 01:11:23.723
Wiener?

01:11:23.896 --> 01:11:31.104
You've always been in my sights
in the forest, rain or shine

01:11:31.856 --> 01:11:40.408
but will I ever get to bag you
my beautiful young bull?

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:52.770
Oh, how it pains me
Without you, I am weak

01:11:53.881 --> 01:12:03.321
for my life is the time
that I can spend with you

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:07.025
When we're on the hunt

01:12:07.258 --> 01:12:08.754
[tango]

01:12:09.265 --> 01:12:12.745
all that matters is you and I

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:20.126
if we need to warm up
we'll share a warm cup in the cabin

01:12:20.871 --> 01:12:22.479
When we're on the hunt

01:12:24.558 --> 01:12:28.263
and the drive is picking up

01:12:29.247 --> 01:12:35.334
the feeling, how it burns
you have a hunting permit for my body

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.843
When we're on the hunt

01:12:53.507 --> 01:12:57.882
my fire only burns for you

01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:04.746
It heats up worse than death
and the wiener grilling bed in me

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:07.117
When we're on the hunt

01:13:08.686 --> 01:13:13.374
it takes however long it takes

01:13:13.494 --> 01:13:19.551
on weekends and on weekdays
my bullets are loaded and ready

01:13:19.927 --> 01:13:28.055
And when you call for me over the radio

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:33.770
You seduce me, you destroy me
when you utter-

01:13:33.771 --> 01:13:35.212
-Kenneth, come.

01:13:35.702 --> 01:13:36.851
Ahh!

01:13:50.035 --> 01:13:53.294
I want you with your gun
and only the hunting cap on

01:13:53.418 --> 01:13:56.226
Take me to the back where you pack

01:13:56.831 --> 01:14:00.060
I've marked up the hunting ground
I've polished my firing pin

01:14:00.259 --> 01:14:03.147
Let's clean our guns on a forest hill

01:14:03.358 --> 01:14:06.230
My life is not in vain

01:14:06.726 --> 01:14:13.240
when you and I are on the hunt

01:14:15.673 --> 01:14:20.753
[applause]

01:14:21.393 --> 01:14:25.223
-Well, I guess we have to go.
-The rifles!

01:14:25.703 --> 01:14:28.638
Let's go this way and check-

01:14:32.271 --> 01:14:33.807
Oh no!

01:14:38.188 --> 01:14:40.812
What did you do, you say?

01:14:42.231 --> 01:14:46.127
How do you shoot a moose by mistake?

01:14:46.655 --> 01:14:49.089
She came out behind a barn
when we were...

01:14:49.177 --> 01:14:50.702
When you were what?

01:14:51.939 --> 01:14:55.623
You think I don't see what's going on,
that I'm that dumb-

01:14:55.722 --> 01:15:00.879
-but I know exactly
what you're doing in those hills!

01:15:03.783 --> 01:15:06.368
You're grilling wieners all day long!

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.861
There is one holy moose cow,
and what do you do?

01:15:14.324 --> 01:15:16.300
Pump her full of lead.

01:15:16.732 --> 01:15:21.820
What's your plan now,
eating cous-cous and grasshoppers?

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:29.436
Congratulations, you're officially
Gambämark's worst moose hunters.

01:15:29.619 --> 01:15:33.345
And that includes seven-foot-Albert
who's both blind and deaf!

01:15:33.593 --> 01:15:36.593
-But somebody had moved the salt lick.
-Silence!

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:42.336
The villagers don't show up for talko,
the forest is barren-

01:15:42.384 --> 01:15:44.928
-but somehow they're still having pie.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:50.172
Josua is barely home,
and now Gunilla is dead.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.666
You could't have picked a worse day.
I get such a headache.

01:15:57.472 --> 01:15:59.092
That's what she said.

01:16:04.848 --> 01:16:09.320
In this village, I do the "she said" jokes.

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:12.489
-Understood?!
-Yes, yes!

01:16:13.263 --> 01:16:14.767
Stop whining.

01:16:15.422 --> 01:16:16.885
Stand up straight.

01:16:24.857 --> 01:16:26.361
Kenneth.

01:16:27.593 --> 01:16:31.761
Did you say someone had moved the salt lick?

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:35.735
Yes, it was right in
the pass by Sjuidaladoback.

01:16:37.527 --> 01:16:40.783
How could someone know you would be there?

01:16:41.767 --> 01:16:44.751
Well, I have no idea.

01:16:45.951 --> 01:16:48.655
I wasn't expecting you to.

01:16:49.807 --> 01:16:52.552
But <i>I</i> have an idea.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.143
Let's get them!

01:17:01.202 --> 01:17:04.929
We are gathered here today
in honor of Gunilla.

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:08.315
We sacrificed her for the revolution-

01:17:08.419 --> 01:17:13.083
-so I have written a little poem
that I would like to recite.

01:17:16.739 --> 01:17:23.383
Your earthly life is now at an end,
and we happily remember all that happened.

01:17:24.375 --> 01:17:29.735
For life gives and death takes
also from those who walk on hooves.

01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:34.887
Your life was a party,
you were out every weekend.

01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:39.110
You were out all the time,
because you were a moose.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:47.686
You enjoyed walking through the autumn leaves
until you died from the hunter's bullet.

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:55.093
You walked proudly the path of life.
Gunilla, we will never forget you.

01:17:56.581 --> 01:17:59.565
Your whirling dance
and playful hoof.

01:17:59.981 --> 01:18:03.358
You'll be honored on Sunday
with a hearty roast.

01:18:05.725 --> 01:18:13.741
[laughter]

01:18:15.173 --> 01:18:17.773
She was lacking in brains-

01:18:18.426 --> 01:18:20.170
-but there was plenty of meat!

01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:27.409
It went just as we planned.
They must be panicking right now.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.416
I have to say, good job.
I'm impressed!

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:36.368
Jjjjjunta!

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:41.689
-Let's strike when they're off balance!
-No, let's keep our heads cool.

01:18:42.201 --> 01:18:49.250
This will play out by itself.
We can just watch the house of cards fall.

01:18:50.436 --> 01:18:53.628
Gita,
come help me with the roast?

01:18:54.012 --> 01:18:55.794
Are you starting dinner now?

01:18:55.986 --> 01:19:00.195
Of course.
You can't revolt on an empty stomach.

01:19:03.963 --> 01:19:06.545
-They're not taking it seriously-
[radio static]

01:19:06.657 --> 01:19:12.681
<i>Okay, boys.</i>
<i>Extra meeting at once.</i>

01:19:14.193 --> 01:19:19.217
<i>But, Kurt.</i>
<i>We're guarding the main freezer box.</i>

01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:23.322
<i>Should we leave it completely exposed?</i>

01:19:24.242 --> 01:19:30.681
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>This more important, and will take all night.</i>

01:19:31.277 --> 01:19:35.229
Oh my god, did you hear?
Now's the time to strike!

01:19:35.433 --> 01:19:37.593
-You really think so?
-Yes yes yes.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.984
Let's take the main freezer box.
There will never be a better time.

01:19:44.676 --> 01:19:48.172
If you don't come,
I'll go by myself.

01:19:52.604 --> 01:19:54.076
Okay.

01:19:54.508 --> 01:19:56.407
If you insist on going by yourself-

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.423
-then go.

01:20:04.569 --> 01:20:07.273
Run, Josua.
Run like the wind!

01:20:07.339 --> 01:20:12.512
<i>-Margita, can you help with dinner?</i>
-No, I'm tidying up.

01:20:13.048 --> 01:20:15.584
And I'm on radio duty.

01:20:15.866 --> 01:20:21.346
There's no point listening to that now.
We can't use anything we get.

01:20:22.569 --> 01:20:23.912
We can't?

01:20:25.806 --> 01:20:30.749
When we moved the salt lick,
we revealed that we can hear them.

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:36.306
We don't want that to be used against us.

01:20:37.682 --> 01:20:41.954
Margita.
Where's the boy?

01:20:45.687 --> 01:21:34.351
[spy music]

01:21:35.727 --> 01:21:39.295
-Josua, it's a trap.
-What are you doing here?

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:47.345
-I see! It's you.
-It was all my idea.

01:21:47.465 --> 01:21:52.417
Don't even try.
I see exactly how it is.

01:21:52.706 --> 01:21:56.242
And what are you going to do about it?
It's two against one.

01:21:58.042 --> 01:21:59.915
Oxen free!

01:22:04.539 --> 01:22:06.099
Freeze!

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:18.682
Josua,
I will give you one more chance.

01:22:19.114 --> 01:22:22.755
Join me,
and together, we can rule Gambämark-

01:22:23.122 --> 01:22:24.938
-as father and son.

01:22:35.882 --> 01:22:37.458
I'll never join you.

01:22:38.722 --> 01:22:42.234
-Get them!
-Run, Josua!

01:22:43.810 --> 01:23:07.410
[chase music]

01:23:11.243 --> 01:23:15.715
-Josua got away.
-Take her to berry cleaning.

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:27.747
[accordion]

01:23:28.227 --> 01:23:32.587
I have fought
for all these years

01:23:33.211 --> 01:23:37.622
and this is
the thanks I get

01:23:38.107 --> 01:23:42.787
for all my labor
suffering and hardship

01:23:43.161 --> 01:23:48.609
a knife in the back
from everyone I hold dear

01:23:52.976 --> 01:23:57.361
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

01:23:58.056 --> 01:24:02.488
although it stings and burns

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:07.987
so if they want to play rough

01:24:08.419 --> 01:24:12.461
I will fight fire with fire

01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:17.749
The people are all going to learn

01:24:18.469 --> 01:24:23.021
They only live in my good graces

01:24:23.536 --> 01:24:27.976
They will pick until their hands turn blue

01:24:28.608 --> 01:24:33.152
and knit and knit until the needles break

01:24:34.016 --> 01:24:38.374
They will work for me, harder than animals

01:24:38.694 --> 01:24:43.254
and I will sell it across the wall

01:24:43.686 --> 01:24:48.230
Berries and socks are in high demand

01:24:48.822 --> 01:24:52.350
and the money goes to me

01:24:52.638 --> 01:24:58.054
It's time for me to make a buck
like a cuckoo in the nest

01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:03.790
Profit from what we've always had
<i>Talko work</i>

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:08.604
I will live in full comfort
while they work for me, the ass

01:25:08.755 --> 01:25:13.844
Never again will I want for anything
<i>Talko work</i>

01:25:14.107 --> 01:25:18.293
If people obey they won't be punished

01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:23.620
<i>Kurt knows what he wants</i>
<i>and he wants what's best for us</i>

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:28.396
If you work hard, you get a cup of coffee

01:25:28.949 --> 01:25:33.685
<i>Kurt knows and understands</i>
<i>and we are fairly compensated</i>

01:25:33.973 --> 01:25:38.973
No whining, no snarling
It's on you if you were led astray

01:25:39.078 --> 01:25:44.361
I was forced into this
and now it's finally time

01:25:45.549 --> 01:25:51.099
It's time for me to make a buck
like a cuckoo in the nest

01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:56.741
Profit from what we've always had
<i>Talko work</i>

01:25:57.005 --> 01:26:01.549
I will live in full comfort
while they work for me, the ass

01:26:01.821 --> 01:26:06.869
Never again will I want for anything
<i>Talko work</i>

01:26:08.431 --> 01:26:11.183
Push harder like a man!

01:26:14.414 --> 01:26:17.990
Have you never mowed a lawn before?!

01:26:22.073 --> 01:26:25.273
Working together is a blessing.

01:26:27.329 --> 01:26:29.265
I can see it ahead

01:26:29.865 --> 01:26:31.657
my talko empire

01:26:32.017 --> 01:26:36.785
The village works all week long
and the money goes into my pocket

01:26:37.153 --> 01:26:39.449
Gold faucets and a new vest

01:26:39.697 --> 01:26:41.945
Build a statue of me on a horse

01:26:42.099 --> 01:26:44.457
and a palace where the community center was

01:26:44.650 --> 01:26:48.050
made out of talko and blood

01:26:48.826 --> 01:26:54.250
It's time for me to make a buck
like a cuckoo in the nest

01:26:54.778 --> 01:26:59.970
Profit from what we've always had
<i>Talko work</i>

01:27:00.202 --> 01:27:04.738
I will live in full comfort
while the work for me, the ass

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:10.351
Never again will I want for anything

01:27:11.178 --> 01:27:13.106
Talko work!

01:27:13.981 --> 01:27:18.325
[applause]

01:27:22.998 --> 01:27:24.901
Dear diary.

01:27:27.445 --> 01:27:30.973
[without music]
Everyone I get close to

01:27:31.798 --> 01:27:34.022
are taken away with a whoosh

01:27:36.064 --> 01:27:39.439
and the worst thing is
that it's because of me

01:27:40.472 --> 01:27:43.408
Everything I touch
withers and dies

01:27:46.631 --> 01:27:49.375
I though revenge would be sweet

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:52.708
but it just led to misery

01:27:53.796 --> 01:27:58.052
Now the junta's gone
and Berit is being thrown out

01:27:58.924 --> 01:28:01.724
and there is nothing that I can do

01:28:04.676 --> 01:28:07.532
Happy birthday, Rafael.

01:28:31.595 --> 01:28:35.947
[heavenly choir]
Josua!

01:28:36.371 --> 01:28:41.323
Gunnar! Is that you?
Are you really here?

01:28:42.235 --> 01:28:46.515
What do you think, drunkard?

01:28:47.915 --> 01:28:49.419
Are you dead?

01:28:49.739 --> 01:28:53.937
No, I showered.

01:28:56.265 --> 01:29:02.961
-You have to tell me what to do.
-Remember what I taught you.

01:29:03.784 --> 01:29:05.636
That it's more fun to drive drunk?

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:08.836
No, not that.

01:29:09.996 --> 01:29:17.884
Don't judge the book by the cover,
even a slow hare changes its coat by winter.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.201
I still don't understand what that means.

01:29:20.257 --> 01:29:27.593
Exactly, that's right,
it has been said, and it will be!

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:29.518
Don't leave me!

01:29:33.338 --> 01:29:34.878
Gunnar?

01:29:35.878 --> 01:29:37.574
Ho-ho?

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.676
I know what I have to do.

01:29:53.761 --> 01:29:55.489
???

01:30:08.756 --> 01:30:11.960
Well, here you are, Berit.

01:30:12.704 --> 01:30:17.647
You thought you could sabotage me
with your insidious plans.

01:30:20.603 --> 01:30:25.595
The junta ladies are deep down
in the potato cellar-

01:30:25.931 --> 01:30:29.141
-peeling until their hands blister.

01:30:30.821 --> 01:30:36.813
And you will be excommunicated
faster than you can say huppalala!

01:30:38.716 --> 01:30:46.595
The whole village will applaud
when we throw you out.

01:30:46.716 --> 01:30:50.248
Who will applaud?
???

01:30:50.658 --> 01:30:55.593
-The whole village will be there.
-The whole village?

01:30:55.977 --> 01:31:00.497
How many showed up for picking talko?
Maybe it'll be the same people.

01:31:01.297 --> 01:31:06.129
-Shut up.
-If you knew what your own son calls you.

01:31:06.905 --> 01:31:11.628
-Weak-Kurt.
-Stop your doubtmongering.

01:31:11.673 --> 01:31:13.497
You can't handle the truth?

01:31:18.031 --> 01:31:23.072
You think you've got it all figured out,
but this time you're wrong.

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:27.335
Huppalala!

01:31:41.508 --> 01:31:42.996
Hi.

01:31:43.496 --> 01:31:44.968
Good day.

01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:50.552
Were you going somewhere?

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:55.754
Yeah.
I'm supposed to guard the talko workers.

01:31:56.530 --> 01:32:01.037
Kurt says someone has to,
what with the statue and palace being built.

01:32:02.536 --> 01:32:04.320
???

01:32:05.664 --> 01:32:07.576
That's right.

01:32:08.928 --> 01:32:13.768
I was going to patrol the wall,
but maybe I'll make some stick bread first.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.080
Alone.

01:32:20.249 --> 01:32:23.665
I'll see you around.

01:32:26.899 --> 01:32:31.650
I do think it's strange
that one man can decide who gets to hunt.

01:32:33.703 --> 01:32:40.855
If one has found someone
that they enjoy hunting with-

01:32:41.503 --> 01:32:45.119
-who are they to say
that it won't do?

01:32:46.367 --> 01:32:51.254
-Kurt knows best.
-Does he?

01:32:55.519 --> 01:32:58.748
He's been out of control
since the thing with the junta and Josua.

01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:01.996
And we can't grill wieners or hunt anymore.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:05.156
Maybe you don't always
have to be on the hunt!

01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:07.791
Maybe it was just a phase.

01:33:10.726 --> 01:33:12.482
So you didn't mean what you said?

01:33:14.227 --> 01:33:17.366
That your life
is not in vain when we're on the hunt?

01:33:17.574 --> 01:33:19.613
I just got a little fired up.

01:33:19.916 --> 01:33:23.032
Se where that got us.
Gunilla is dead, all because we...

01:33:23.228 --> 01:33:24.900
...grilled our wieners.

01:33:27.517 --> 01:33:30.222
What's the point of being out hunting now?

01:33:34.427 --> 01:33:37.432
To see the sun rising over the moors.

01:33:39.056 --> 01:33:41.520
And the steam rising from the thermos.

01:33:42.064 --> 01:33:45.275
And the smell
of that first cup of coffee

01:33:47.537 --> 01:33:50.638
And achieving
those perfect wiener grilling embers.

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.188
Just being together.

01:33:54.317 --> 01:33:55.753
You and I...

01:33:57.909 --> 01:33:59.397
...on the hunt.

01:34:04.637 --> 01:34:09.297
No, I have to go,
or Kurt will be mad.

01:34:09.337 --> 01:34:14.752
Fine, go,
if you care more about Kurt and his insanity.

01:34:15.928 --> 01:34:19.856
But if you ever want me
as your hunting partner again...

01:34:21.512 --> 01:34:26.993
...you'll come here,
sit down, and make stick bread with me.

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:38.748
-Klas!
-What?

01:34:39.818 --> 01:34:42.519
But I don't want any damn stick bread.

01:34:43.975 --> 01:34:46.415
Let's show them what a bonfire is!

01:34:51.303 --> 01:34:55.460
[march with organ and bells]

01:34:55.669 --> 01:35:00.802
Out of the village you are thrown

01:35:01.050 --> 01:35:06.122
Those who neglect the Book
are erased

01:35:06.370 --> 01:35:11.922
Our village says shame,
you are thrown out, that's it.

01:35:15.152 --> 01:35:20.380
By the power vested in me as elected official
I sentence you to excommunication.

01:35:20.535 --> 01:35:24.604
???

01:35:29.564 --> 01:35:31.172
Berit Backull!

01:35:31.596 --> 01:35:36.412
You are sentenced for countless sins
and dirty deeds of your own will-

01:35:36.551 --> 01:35:39.812
-rejecting our holy Book of the Homestead.

01:35:40.442 --> 01:35:45.194
Book of the Homestead,
chapter one, verse nine.

01:35:47.298 --> 01:35:52.713
"Today, dad was a real asshole."
What is this?

01:35:53.409 --> 01:35:55.908
Is this what you're looking for?

01:35:57.243 --> 01:36:01.714
-Josua, what are you doing?
-I have the Book-

01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:04.490
-and it's my turn to read it to you.

01:36:05.216 --> 01:36:12.001
Kurt Byman, my old man,
has broken the most important rules of the Book.

01:36:12.041 --> 01:36:13.835
-Never!
-Listen-

01:36:14.130 --> 01:36:18.882
"One should be happy, not pretentious."
Book of the Homestead 1:1.

01:36:20.631 --> 01:36:25.663
"Work together and share fairly."
Book of the Homestead 1:2.

01:36:26.618 --> 01:36:31.239
"Put the village before yourself."
Book of the Homstead 1:3.

01:36:31.926 --> 01:36:35.806
-Stop it.
-I could go on all day-

01:36:35.886 --> 01:36:38.534
-and you would be guilty on every charge.

01:36:40.222 --> 01:36:41.614
Klas and Kenneth...

01:36:43.722 --> 01:36:46.026
...seize him
and take him to berry cleaning.

01:36:46.205 --> 01:36:52.669
[continuous dreamy tone]

01:36:53.345 --> 01:36:57.488
You have only brought
misery to this village.

01:36:58.381 --> 01:37:03.437
It's time to pay for what you've done,
for everyone you've excommunicated!

01:37:06.006 --> 01:37:09.158
You're the worst shot I know.

01:37:10.272 --> 01:37:13.336
When we played cards last week,
I let you win. Ha ha ha!

01:37:13.848 --> 01:37:17.871
If you only knew
what I put in your pastries!

01:37:19.389 --> 01:37:21.813
You got something there.
Ha ha ha!

01:37:21.934 --> 01:37:25.110
-You're a bad leader!
-Ugly moustache!

01:37:25.144 --> 01:37:27.379
And your jokes are crap!

01:37:27.442 --> 01:37:31.002
-Say "my dixie wrecked"!
-My dick's -- no!

01:37:33.810 --> 01:37:36.644
-You're weak.
-Weak-Kurt!

01:37:37.188 --> 01:37:40.588
Weak-Kurt, Weak-Kurt, Weak-Kurt!

01:37:41.139 --> 01:37:43.085
You're not my dad anymore.

01:37:50.136 --> 01:38:04.104
[piano]

01:38:05.504 --> 01:38:11.104
Everything on my conscience

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.736
seeps out in this berry hell

01:38:18.232 --> 01:38:25.488
and I see
the bottom being revealed

01:38:27.344 --> 01:38:31.456
as I sort through my shame

01:38:34.076 --> 01:38:39.756
Saying sorry
feels far too weak

01:38:41.745 --> 01:38:46.761
I was wrong
but I realized it too late

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:51.054
I was tough
and cold

01:38:51.414 --> 01:38:55.478
My soul froze to ice

01:38:56.974 --> 01:39:00.966
like the berries, in a way

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:09.518
I am a shadow of a man

01:39:09.998 --> 01:39:16.309
Oh, berries can turn to sand

01:39:16.712 --> 01:39:23.669
I was blind
The village suffered because of me

01:39:24.157 --> 01:39:29.957
so I finally know what I am

01:39:30.341 --> 01:39:34.581
I am an asshole

01:39:35.413 --> 01:39:38.069
who ruins everything

01:39:38.613 --> 01:39:44.693
An asshole who just wanted it
like it used to be

01:39:45.013 --> 01:39:51.989
A full-on ass, oooh

01:39:52.997 --> 01:39:58.245
and now I know I deserve a kick in...

01:39:59.109 --> 01:40:02.725
...the ass

01:40:14.925 --> 01:40:21.905
I wanted to build utopia
so I put up a wall

01:40:22.223 --> 01:40:29.175
I thought I built my dream
but the dream became a cage

01:40:29.519 --> 01:40:36.239
I just wanted to have a say
here in my fantasy

01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:42.791
I thought I was the shit
but I was holier-than-thou

01:40:43.159 --> 01:40:47.711
I am an asshole

01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:51.097
who ruins everything

01:40:51.335 --> 01:40:57.455
An asshole who just wanted it
like it used to be

01:40:57.687 --> 01:41:05.327
A full-on ass, oooh

01:41:05.631 --> 01:41:10.927
and now I know I deserve a kick in...

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:18.423
...the ass!

01:41:18.727 --> 01:41:21.839
I know it now

01:41:24.063 --> 01:41:33.703
Kurt Byman is an asshole

01:41:35.495 --> 01:41:40.887
[applause]

01:41:41.487 --> 01:41:43.247
Klas and Kenneth!

01:41:44.183 --> 01:41:46.401
Seize him
and take him to berry cleaning.

01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:48.182
Wait a minute.

01:42:07.886 --> 01:42:12.830
If we punish him,
we're doing the same thing he did to us-

01:42:12.929 --> 01:42:18.905
-and maintain the same toxic system,
continuing the endless cycle of oppression.

01:42:20.865 --> 01:42:24.120
True!
I was just thinking that.

01:42:25.321 --> 01:42:26.827
Josua.

01:42:30.418 --> 01:42:32.154
Berit is right.

01:42:34.336 --> 01:42:36.293
We can't go on like that.

01:42:43.763 --> 01:42:45.996
I was born behind a wall.

01:42:46.146 --> 01:42:52.770
[inspiring music]

01:42:54.002 --> 01:43:01.746
A wall that was to protect us from the world.
It was to be the best place on earth.

01:43:11.581 --> 01:43:13.452
But that's not what happened.

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:23.437
Because all shoes
don't fit all feet.

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:28.660
They may fit you,
but gives someone else blisters.

01:43:30.005 --> 01:43:33.045
You can't tell people
how to live their lives.

01:43:33.245 --> 01:43:38.000
You can't say force people to have a good time
because that's coercion-

01:43:39.029 --> 01:43:40.624
-or a sing-along.

01:43:41.945 --> 01:43:44.368
And god knows we have enough of that.

01:43:45.857 --> 01:43:50.787
And we don't need more walls either.
We have enough of them...

01:43:52.019 --> 01:43:53.869
...inside.

01:43:53.909 --> 01:43:57.707
They are there because we are scared
of that which is strange, but-

01:43:58.795 --> 01:44:00.348
-strange is good.

01:44:01.614 --> 01:44:05.696
I have a dream that
those who want everyone to be normal-

01:44:05.952 --> 01:44:08.673
-would let themselves
be a little strange.

01:44:09.808 --> 01:44:14.942
There is hope,
because a wise man once told me-

01:44:14.963 --> 01:44:18.155
-that even a slow hare changes coat by winter.

01:44:20.531 --> 01:44:24.731
And dad,
you were right about one thing.

01:44:27.211 --> 01:44:28.947
It was better like it used to be...

01:44:30.769 --> 01:44:33.920
...before we started thinking
that it was better like it used to be.

01:44:41.848 --> 01:44:47.586
So let's vote.
Who wants to tear down the wall for a bright...

01:44:47.626 --> 01:44:51.649
[chainsaw]

01:44:52.382 --> 01:44:56.534
[disco]

01:44:56.848 --> 01:45:00.726
Shut up, let's dance!

01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:10.078
Woo!

01:45:10.224 --> 01:45:14.362
-Mäskis-Gunnar, you came back!
-Of course, I got so bored-

01:45:14.562 --> 01:45:16.396
-and it's Rafael's birthday!

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.620
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've been out to see thw world-

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:25.308
-but I had to come back
and give you some more boogie woogie.

01:45:25.676 --> 01:45:29.156
When had been thrown out
I went out for a drive

01:45:29.892 --> 01:45:33.300
Now I have traveled
all around the world

01:45:34.072 --> 01:45:37.503
I came to New York
and the west coast of Sweden

01:45:37.856 --> 01:45:41.927
Rio de Janeiro
and Härmä Fitness Center

01:45:42.299 --> 01:45:45.969
But Manhattan
was full of simpletons

01:45:46.423 --> 01:45:49.551
and Alahärmi has nothing but Finns

01:45:49.599 --> 01:45:51.939
I've been searching everywhere

01:45:52.114 --> 01:45:54.074
for someone that is square

01:45:54.258 --> 01:45:57.932
but everyone around the world
are village eccentrics

01:45:58.156 --> 01:46:03.100
Shut up, let's dance
Mäskis-Gunnar's boogie woogie, wo-oh

01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:06.237
I'm telling you
sha ha ha-

01:46:06.369 --> 01:46:11.368
-shut up, let's dance
It's fine to be a little strange, wo-oh

01:46:11.861 --> 01:46:14.702
We all share a globe
chock full of weirdos

01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:23.237
Amen, hear him preach
Everyone is strange like Mäskis-Gunnar

01:46:23.469 --> 01:46:31.517
Amen, that's a proper takeaway
In Gambämark, strange is now the new normal

01:46:31.717 --> 01:46:35.367
Imagine standing here
watching a new day rise

01:46:35.481 --> 01:46:39.529
I knew that we could do it,
this is the village I know

01:46:39.697 --> 01:46:43.577
We may have been a bit lost
but we dared to feel

01:46:44.033 --> 01:46:47.684
Now we're all one family
-Has anyone seen Kenneth?

01:46:47.772 --> 01:46:52.714
Shut up, let's dance
Mäskis-Gunnar's boogie woogie, wo-oh

01:46:53.098 --> 01:46:55.810
I'm telling you
sha ha ha-

01:46:56.010 --> 01:47:00.994
-shut up, let's dance
It's fine to be a little strange, wo-oh

01:47:01.402 --> 01:47:04.209
We all share a globe
chock full of weirdos

01:47:05.345 --> 01:47:07.281
Woo, here it goes!

01:47:13.852 --> 01:47:15.428
Wooeee!

01:47:20.829 --> 01:47:25.115
And stop! Take your foot
Move your booty in a big boogie woogie

01:47:25.156 --> 01:47:28.715
And hop! How does it feel
Let's take it from the top

01:47:28.827 --> 01:47:33.523
I said stop! ???
Copacabana, let me do that conga

01:47:33.643 --> 01:47:36.976
Hop! Give me more
Listen to me now

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.304
There's not a single person
who's middle of the road

01:47:42.008 --> 01:47:45.416
That is all there is to it
Signed, Gunnar Mäsk

01:47:45.592 --> 01:47:49.306
Hold on,
because it's time for a dance battle!

01:47:49.474 --> 01:47:53.954
Stand in a semi-circle.
First, Klas versus Berit.

01:47:54.434 --> 01:47:58.738
Go Klas, go Klas!
A paso doble with the hunting cap!

01:48:00.387 --> 01:48:02.571
And Berit, you are up.

01:48:02.755 --> 01:48:07.563
Be-be-be-be-be-Berit!
Go, go-go, go, Berit!

01:48:07.699 --> 01:48:10.573
Next, Josua and Kurt.
Show him how it is, Josua.

01:48:10.968 --> 01:48:14.212
Josua! Go Josua! Go Josua!
It's a breakdance with a twist-

01:48:14.268 --> 01:48:18.876
-and from Kurt?
Wings followed by a backflip!

01:48:19.092 --> 01:48:22.916
Wow, this is amazing
I think I understand

01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:27.188
Hold on so I can write it
in the Book of the Homestead 2

01:48:28.652 --> 01:48:29.273
Uhm, no...

01:48:29.313 --> 01:48:34.166
Shut up, let's dance
Mäskis-Gunnar's boogie woogie, wo-oh

01:48:34.526 --> 01:48:37.190
I'm telling you

01:48:37.406 --> 01:48:42.478
-shut up, let's dance

01:48:45.695 --> 01:48:50.683
Shut up, let's dance
Mäskis-Gunnar's boogie woogie, wo-oh

01:48:51.115 --> 01:48:53.756

01:48:53.979 --> 01:48:59.019

01:49:11.313 --> 01:49:15.713
